In order to run this application, there are a couple of steps. This project depends on the module spotify-web-api-java
version 6.5.4, and the setup is slightly strange. To replicate our setup, please use the IntelliJ IDE. In IntelliJ,
create a project from Existing Sources and import the directory. The .idea directory might help with the setup here, but
in the project files, specify that the project SDK is adopt-openjdk-13 version 13.0.2, with the language level at SDK default. Then,
in the Modules tab, select Library> From Maven, then put "se.michaelthelin.spotify:spotify-web-api-java:6.5.4" into the
search bar. Use version 6.5.4 when it comes up. Specify then that the Module SDK is 16. After that, the next step is
running the class. You need to set up a run configuration, building the SpotifyInteraction class with adopt-openjdk-13
and no arguments. From there, you should be good to run. Run the configuration you just set up, and when the
authorization url shows up, sign into a Spotify account. It would be good to have one ready to go, since you only have
20 seconds to sign in and approve the app. Once the authorization has been approved, the program will prompt you for the
name of the song, the artist and the name of your desired playlist. Make sure that the title and artist name match
exactly, or the program will fail. From there, just wait and see your playlist appear in your Spotify account library!

For troubleshooting, please email me at psprao@seas.upenn.edu so we don't fail.

later).
